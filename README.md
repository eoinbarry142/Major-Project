This is my 4th year Major Project that is currently in development. It is a game called Mana developed using Unreal Engine 4 in C++.

## Features
* Procedural generation scripts written in C++ to randomly spawn shrines on complex landscape.
* Player interaction with shrines.
* More features currently in development...

## Installation
*The game is being developed in Unreal Engine 4.27.2 which is required to open the project. Visual Studio may also be required to generate project files.
*Clone the repository to a folder on your computer.
*Double click the MajorProject.uproject file (if this does not generate the project files then right click the file instead and select "Generate Visual Studio project files". You should then be able to double click the file).
*The game will then open in the Unreal game engine and you can press play on the toolbar at the top of the screen to run the application.
